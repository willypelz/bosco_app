Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both on an ad hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

## Snyk SBT CLI Plugin

This plugin provides dependency metadata for SBT projects that use `sbt` and have a `build.sbt` file.

## Compability

`snyk-sbt-plugin` has been tested against jdk 8-12. 

`jdk13` is not currently supported (See this [comment](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-sbt-plugin/pull/61#issuecomment-521356342) for more details)
